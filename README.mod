These are a set of programs that I have written (mainly in modern Fortran 2008) and used in my own computational chemical physics research to perform various types of analyses on molecular dynamics trajectories obtained from CP2K classical and density functional theory simulations (see https://www.cp2k.org). The systems simulated are often assumed to be aqueous but sometimes with a surface present or a solute. The programs are documented and relatively straightforward to follow. Analyses from some of these programs has appeared in some of my publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals (see my Google Scholar page at https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aCHazwkAAAAJ&hl=en).
